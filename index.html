                            <p><strong>A. Team name: Invincible</strong> <br> <strong>B.Personal Information</strong> <br> <strong>1.

As a Digital Marketer, he also pays attention to some parts of IT knowledge. They include data analysis, big data, website coding, mobile app, cyber security. he wish that he could be professional in all these fields, which will be useful for my job. But he now must focus more on Digital Marketing, which is his main career path. <br> <strong>3. Warren Cheah</strong> <br>Student ID: 3778714 <br> Email: s3778714@student.rmit.edu.au  <br> He is currently studying Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT University. He is international student from Malaysia and can speak five different languages, there are English, Mandarin, Cantonese, Malay and a dialect Hakka. Learning all these languages isn’t that hard for me since I’ve been speaking them when he was young. English and Chinese (Mandarin) are the languages that required me work hard for me to improve my speaking and most importantly, listening and writing. The range of his interests in Information Technology is wide. he would just like to know anything about IT right now. For examples, he wants to know how some apps works, how do they function, what programs and codes are used in order to run it, how people or businesses uses technology in their workplaces or in their own times and so on. Basically, he is kind of interested in anything that is related to IT having said that, after 4 weeks of lectures and practicals, he personally find that programming is interesting even though it gets really complicated sometimes. <br> <strong>4. Amante Docherty</strong> <br> Student ID:3785537 <br> Email:s3785537@student.rmit.edu.au <br> He is a first-year student at RMIT University studying Information Technology. he was born in Melbourne Australia and am currently living in Werribee with his Mum, Dad and his two younger sisters. Some of his hobbies include gaming, freestyle BMX, and watching such like YouTube or Netflix. Games that he like to play are mainly motorsport games like Assetto Corsa, Forza, Gran Turismo and Need for Speed. Other genres of games he like are fps, open world games and whatever he can play for free. In my spare time when he doesn't feel like playing games he like to watch YouTube and Netflix. YouTube videos that he like to watch are car related videos, gaming videos, vlogs, music videos and fashion/streetwear videos. His interest in IT is how it is now associated with many aspects of our lives and society, as well as the things that we can create with the help of IT. Another part of IT which he has an interest in is games, as they have been part of most of my life. A reason he have chosen IT is so that he can learn about what goes on behind the technology that people use daily. he find it fascinating that technology has created the world we are living in today and that the possibilities of it are endless. From when he was born to know technology has advanced greatly, providing new capabilities with appliances that were first created many years before. An example of this are mobile phones which are now able to take photos/videos, answer questions, give you directions, communicate with people from all around the world via text, voice or video, etc. His interest in IT is to be part of its growth and applications to make the world a better place. <br> <strong>5.Jake Farrugia </strong> <br> Student number: 3786398 <br> Email: s3786398@student.rmit.edu.au <br> His Nationality is Australian, and he is studying Bachelor of IT in RMIT University. His mother language English. Interesting Fact (Hobbies): His hobbies include all kinds of technology, but he also quite enjoy movies and video games. His interest in IT is various and widespread, he has interest in a lot of different areas of IT, some of these areas include smartphones/tablets, Televisions, PC’s, Movies, and Video Games. His interest in these areas involve the technical specification and capabilities of these hardware but also how they work, and how to make these things work with the given hardware. His formal IT experience came in the form of work experience in a school’s IT department, where he learnt some basics about switches, network troubleshooting, sending in machines for repairs, or doing the repairs, as well as imaging. However, he has done some stuff personally such as set up home theatre systems, file servers, and maintain technology as well as consult with other people on their potential purchases. <br> <strong>C. Team Profile</strong> <br><strong>1. Doan Minh Chinh:</strong> the first test is 16 personality show his personality is ESFJ-A. ESFJ is person who love to support friend and family, get up social assemble and try the best to make sure everyone is happy. With Education Planner test, he is tactile learner, he learns by touching and doing. He can remember things and understand problem by physical movement. You are a "hands-on" learner who prefers to touch, move, build, or draw what you learn, and you tend to learn better when some type of physical activity is involved. (Tactile) <br><strong>2.Pham Viet Nam:</strong> Each of three tests above means different things about his personality. My MBTI test results that my personality is ESFJ-A. ESFJ is people who enjoy supporting their friends and loved ones, organizing social gatherings and doing their best to make sure everyone is happy. The Learning test describes me as a visual learner. A visual learner learns by reading or seeing pictures. he understand and remember things by sight. He can picture what he am learning in my head, and he learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. The result of Big Five Personality test reveals that he has positive emotions, has no fear. he am an extrovert and has high conscientiousness. These results reveal his behavior in a team, that he am an extrovert, easy to collaborate, and has positive emotions. In fact, he is often a leader at work, and he has cooperative leadership style. When forming a team, he should use my leadership strength, which is the ability of encouraging cooperation. This style is more appropriate for a team of new or unskillful members. On the other hand, if he form a team of experienced members, he should try to leave them more space, just give them direction, and let them find their own ways to finish their tasks. (Visual) <br> <strong>3. Warren Cheah:</strong> The results from all the 3 tests above shows that he is more like a quiet and observant person. It also shows that he sensitives to other emotion when making decision. This mean that he is more empathic and less competitive than Thinking types and focus on social harmony and cooperation. Besides that, the results show that he is a more assertive person and is resistant to stress. This could affect him in not worrying too much and not pushing myself too hard when it comes to achieving goals. he is also an easy-going person which he can easily agree to people ideas and thoughts, lacking self-thoughts. (Tactile) <br> <strong>4. Amante Docherty: </strong> From completing these tests is shows what his personality type is, his learning style and his ability to solve mechanical problems. The personality test that he attempted was from the 16 personalities website which declared his personality type as a defender. This indicates that he more of an introvert rather than an extravert and is observant rather than intuitive, meaning he is someone who is more comfortable with rational reasoning when making a decision and that he is not comfortable communicating with people. His learning style fit both tactile and visual meaning he learns best from doing and touching, and reading and seeing pictures. In a team his introvert trait may make it difficult to communicate effectively however his observant trait make it seem like he will be understanding with group decisions. When forming a team it is good for members to be friendly and for there to be a leader to guide and motivate him, and the group towards the end goal. (Tactile and visual) <br> <strong>5. Jake Farrugia:</strong> The results of these tests show to me that he is a visual learner, and that he is an observant person that likes to think about and observe a situation before he goes into it. It also shows that I’m an easy to get along with person. These results may influence his behavior in a team in that he am likely to observe the idea in action and think about the best way to go about the project is, but also that he can work well in a team because he get along with others easily. he can take these things into account when forming a team by observing what our project is but also by listening to the other team members to find the best solution for the project. (Visual <br> =>Two members (Chinh & Warren) are tactile learners and other two members (Viet Nam & Jake) are visual learner. Team members in group tend to be less competitive in thinking idea and need someone have leadership style to assemble ideas and decide which one will be the best. Teammates easily agree with the ideas and tend to work as a group to support each other to complete the project. <br><strong>D. Ideal Jobs</strong> <br> 1. Doan Minh Chinh: Junior Developer <br>2. Pham Viet Nam: Digital Marketing Manager or Marketing Executive <br>3. Warren Cheah: IT Architects <br> 4. Amante Docherty: IT cyber security analyst <br> 5. Jake Farrugia: Analyst Programmer/Engineer at NAB <br> <strong>Common elements:</strong> All ideal jobs require the IT background and have knowledge in programming language. The difference between each position is Chinh’s job requires a wide range of the programming field. Nam’s job is more relevant to marketing and communication skills. Analyst programmer is job about the analysis of data of the customers and the candidate works as coding, testing and design solution for each problem. Amante’s ideal jobs are in common with Jake because this jobs request collection and analysis of data, help and guide the implementation of new projects. The differences include working in privacy and protect company data and prevent trespasses, technical support. IT architect requires more duties than the others such as developing system demand, designing and maintaining computer network for organizations and business companies.</p>
